# Function timeout settings
# Netlify free tier: 10 seconds default, 26 seconds max
# Netlify Pro: up to 26 seconds

[functions]
  # Note: Netlify has limits on function execution time
  # Free tier: 10s default, 26s max
  # Pro tier: up to 26s
  # Background processing continues after function returns, but may be killed on timeout
  # Consider using Netlify Background Functions or external queue for long-running tasks

# Scheduled Functions (Cron Jobs)
# Netlify scheduled functions run on a schedule and call API endpoints
# The process-queue endpoint is configured to run every 2 minutes
# Configure via Netlify dashboard: Site settings → Functions → Scheduled functions
# Or use Netlify API to create/update the scheduled function

# Environment variables will be set in Netlify dashboard
# Make sure to add all variables from .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are required at build time
